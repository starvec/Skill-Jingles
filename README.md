# Skill Jingles
This Runelite plugin enables skill jingles (the short bits of music that play when one of your skill's level increases) even when the in-game music is muted.  Normally, muting the in-game music also disables these jingles.

More information regarding skill jingles can be found on the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Jingles#Level_up_jingles">OSRS Wiki<a>.
